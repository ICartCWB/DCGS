# DCGS ‚Äì Discrete Cadastral Grid System

‚ö†Ô∏è *Working title ‚Äì this is a conceptual and research-stage repository. The project name may change as implementation evolves.*

## üìç Overview

DCGS is a **Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS)** specifically designed for **terrestrial cadastral mapping**. Unlike general-purpose DGGSs, DCGS prioritizes cadastral accuracy, equal-area indexing, GNSS compatibility, and blockchain integration.

This project is based on the academic article:

## üåé Motivation

Cadastral systems require high-resolution and legally reliable mapping. Traditional GIS platforms struggle to provide scalable, interoperable frameworks that integrate blockchain or GNSS with cadastral needs.  
DCGS addresses this by offering:
- Equal-area parallelogram-based cell structure  
- Sinusoidal projection over the ellipsoidal Earth model  
- Metric-based multiscale indexing  
- Centimeter-level compatibility with GNSS systems  
- Blockchain-ready cell encoding for immutable spatial records

## üß± Design Highlights

| **Design Criteria**         | **DCGS Solution**                                        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose-Oriented            | Matches cadastral scales with minimal distortion         |
| Equal-Area Cells            | Uses uniform area cells, even over an ellipsoid          |
| Multi-Scale Support         | 1-to-4 and 1-to-25 refinement hierarchy                  |
| GNSS Compatibility          | Aligns with WGS84 ellipsoid at centimeter resolution     |
| Simple Shape                | Uses parallelograms for computation and clarity          |
| Blockchain Integration      | Indexes designed for tokenization and traceability       |
| Geoprofessionals Usability  | Follows Cartesian logic familiar to geoinformation users |

## üß© Indexing Method

DCGS uses a hybrid indexing strategy:
- Quadrants (`NW`, `NE`, etc.) as primary level  
- 10 km √ó 10 km cells for Resolution 1  
- Hierarchical refinements:  
  - 1-to-4: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`  
  - 1-to-25: `A1` to `E5`

Resolution levels span from 10 km down to 1 cm, supporting both rural parcels and detailed urban divisions.

## üöß Future Work

The following are planned for implementation:

- üîß Algorithm development (cell generation, coordinate conversion)  
- üíæ Binary codification and indexing optimization
- üó∫Ô∏è GIS integration modules and tools
